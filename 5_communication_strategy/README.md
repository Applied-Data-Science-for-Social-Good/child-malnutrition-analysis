# Communication/Report Strategy

## Overview

The **Malnutrition Analysis Report** serves as a primary artifact
demonstrating our analytical workflow with global health datasets. It is
intended to show the rigor and methodology applied rather than to present
novel global health impacts.

This README outlines how we position the report and our intended audience.

## Purpose of the Report as an Artifact

- Document a complete multi-phase analysis of global malnutrition data.
- Showcase technical skills in data cleaning, merging, visualization,
  and advanced modeling.
  dataset exploration.
- Offer interpretive insights while remaining cautious about causal claims.

## Target Audience

Our primary audience includes:

- Individuals or teams working in **global or public health analytics**.
- Organizations evaluating **analytical skills, methodology, and
  reproducibility** in complex datasets.
- Professionals interested in **how analysis is performed**, rather than
  immediate policy or intervention outcomes.

The report is designed to demonstrate **competence in global health data
analysis**, highlighting technical workflow, statistical reasoning, and
interpretive rigor.

## Key Takeaways

- The report is a **skills-focused artifact**, not a policy or advocacy tool.
- Analytical methods and dataset handling are central to its purpose.
- Targeting evaluators and peers in global/public health analytics
  ensures the work is contextualized correctly.
