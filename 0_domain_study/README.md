# Domain 0 – Research Framing and Conceptual Foundation

## 1. Purpose of this work

This project uses child malnutrition as a global health case to demonstrate data
science skills across five analysis phases. The aim is skill development and
clear analytical workflow design rather than producing new scientific findings.
Any real-world insight, such as understanding how national factors relate to
malnutrition across countries worldwide, is an added benefit. If no new impact
emerges, that is acceptable because the primary objective is analytical practice
and reproducibility.

## 2. Problem statement

Child malnutrition remains widespread, especially in countries facing poverty,
instability, conflict, displacement, and weak public services. This notebook
examines how national characteristics relate to these patterns. The indicators
used are:

- Economic factors: GDP per capita, income group  
- Stability factors: Refugee population as a conflict proxy  
- Mother's education: Female education levels  
- Food security: Undernourishment prevalence  

The goal is not causal claims but structured exploration using transparent data
science methods.

## 3. Systemic thinking models applied

### The Iceberg Model applied to global child malnutrition

**Events (visible tip):**  
We observe widespread child malnutrition, especially in regions affected by
conflict, displacement, weak food systems, and poverty. These symptoms are
visible in global reports and humanitarian monitoring.

**Patterns (below the surface):**  
Common trends appear across regions, such as chronic malnutrition in unstable
states, food system disruptions during crises, improvements that reverse over
time, and inequality-driven divides between populations. These patterns show
that malnutrition follows long-term structural pathways.

**Underlying structures (deeper layer):**  
These forces repeatedly shape malnutrition outcomes: conflict, displacement,
weak governance, low income, inequality, limited female education, fragile
health and sanitation systems, and global market pressures that make food
unaffordable. These structures determine access, resilience, and stability.

**Mental models and root assumptions (deepest layer):**  
These include policy priorities favoring economic gain over wellbeing,
assumptions that hunger is inevitable, acceptance of global inequality, and
institutional habits that reinforce the status quo. The iceberg model reframes
malnutrition as a system-level outcome rather than isolated data points.

## 4. Research question

**RQ0:** How do economic conditions, income groups, stability indicators,
female education, and food security indicators relate to global patterns and
trends of malnutrition across countries worldwide?

## 5. Skills practiced

- Multi-source data merging and cleaning  
- Handling missingness and building indicators  
- Exploratory statistics and visualization  
- ANOVA, Tukey tests, and group comparisons  
- Time-series trend analysis  
- Systemic and structural reasoning  
- Narrative data storytelling  
- Reproducible workflow creation

## 6. Impact and limitations

**Potential impact:**  
The project offers a clear example of how data science methods can explore
global health issues and may support learning for students and analysts.

**Limitations:**  
Global observational data cannot prove causality. Structural drivers such as
political history or full displacement impacts are only partially measured. The
results should be viewed as associations and structured insights, not definitive
causal conclusions.
